# EEG data acquisition information
The Brainsproduct MR system was utilized to record the EEG in the study, and subjects were required to wear 64-electrode cap. The electrode caps were distributed by the 10-20 extended electrode system, with the online reference electrodes being bilateral mastoids and the ground electrode in the frontal midline. Digital-to-analog converter: 16-bit, Low-pass filter: 0-250Hz, High-pass filter 0.016Hz/10s, Synchronous trigger signal input: >16-bit. The P300 used Analyzer 2.0 software for offline analysis and processing, online conversion of reference electrodes, and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) removal of artifacts.
